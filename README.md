### Specifics about Bootstrap
We used the Bootstrap framework through-out this project and as such there
is one thing to realize in the classes for a couple of the Bootstrap components. Bootstrap includes a wide range of shorthand css styles for their elements such as `mb` which equivalates to the bottom margin and `bg` which is the background. An example would be the following:
```html
      <div class="card mb-4 bg-light">
```
We do this within the class since we use multiple card elements and changing the 
styling of this through an external css source would mean giving each card it's own name and this method of changing the Bootstrap component directly is much easier.
